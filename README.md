# CDK Introduction

I gave this talk at [Serverless Computing London](https://serverlesscomputing.london/) Nov 2019

The PDF and keynote are in [slides](./slides/) you can also find it on [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/ranguard/aws-cdk-introduction-191140240).

I used the wonderful [demo-magic](https://github.com/paxtonhare/demo-magic) to prepare and execute the demo's. And the really nice [mirror-displays](https://github.com/fcanas/mirror-displays) command-line tool to automatically switch between mirrored (for demo) and not mirrored (for presentation, so I get to see the next slide as I'm talking).

### NOTE on the demo's

The code / run scripts are here for reference, it's not setup to run from this repository... if I give the talk again I'll sort it out properly.
